2. Loaded the comments file into the Google Colab notebook and imported the required libraries.
3. Preprocessed the text by removing stop words and unnecessary characters.
4. Implemented a function to calculate sentiment scores and classify comments as positive or negative.
5. Iterated through all comments to compute sentiment values.
6. Segregated words based on sentiment to generate separate word clouds for positive and negative comments.
7. Aggregated individual sentiments to derive an overall sentiment for the trailer.
